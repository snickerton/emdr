## What is EMDR?

[Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_desensitization_and_reprocessing) is a psychotherapy treatment designed to alleviate the distress associated with traumatic memories. Developed by Francine Shapiro in the late 1980s, EMDR therapy involves the use of bilateral stimulation (visual, auditory, and/or tactile) while the client focuses on traumatic memories.

The bilateral stimulation is thought to facilitate the processing of traumatic memories, helping the brain to store them differently and reduce their emotional impact. EMDR has been recognized as an effective treatment for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) by many organizations including the American Psychological Association and the World Health Organization.
